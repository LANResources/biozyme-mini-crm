## Written Interview Questions

1. How did you come to learn Ruby and Rails?
2. If you could change one thing about Rails, what would it be and why?
3. How do you stay up to date with your technical knowledge?
4. How do you balance adhering to Rails conventions with introducing custom abstractions?
5. There are multiple ways to structure a modern Rails application. One approach is to render HTML views directly from the server (potentially using tools like Hotwire or Stimulus). Another is to use Rails primarily as an API and build the front end with a JavaScript framework such as React or Vue.  What are you thoughts on the trade-offs between these two approaches?  Can you describe your comfort level with each one?
